# GiphySearch
Chemi Collins
I created a website with the primary function of being to search for gifs.
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript on this project.

User Stories

1. As a web developer, I used this giphy search app to find a gif to use in a project that I'm currently working on.

2. As a content creator, I used this giphy search app to find a funny gif to share with my followers.

3. As an avid social media consumer who loves to share content with my friends and family, I consistently use this app to find gifs to fit almost any situation that we might be discussing.

Ideas for future improvement

1. I would like to do more with the styling of the page.

2. I would like to add a share option to my page so that users can share directly from my website.

3. I would like to add a feature that would enable my users to save their favorite gifs on the page, so that they are easily accessible when they return to use them.
